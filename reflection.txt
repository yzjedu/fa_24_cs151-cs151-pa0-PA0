I thoroughly enjoyed doing this PA and solving a problem for one of my closest friends. She has been trying to find the right size storage container 
to fit under her bed, but she hates doing math and doesn’t have the time to do it all by herself. I’m glad I was able to solve this and can continue 
helping her with things like this in the future. I really like programming by myself. I believe it gave me more time to understand everything I was 
doing however I do also enjoy working with a partner as well incase they might know something I don’t or might be forgetting. If I were to do this assignment 
again I think I would maybe come up with a simpler way to execute it.
